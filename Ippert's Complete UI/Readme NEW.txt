There are some mods made to the original IppertUi, what I made by my self.
Like:
-Add the Ekanta command panel.
-Move the IdleVillagerBanner to the center of the screen and make it bigger

-If you want to see how it looks then copy the uimain.xml from data folder.

-If you want to use the original IppertUi, just copy the xmb file from:
 Data\RESPALDO ORIGINAL XMB - Ippert to the 'data' folder of the game
